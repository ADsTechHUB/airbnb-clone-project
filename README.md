#### 📌 Importance of Identifying Design Properties
Understanding and documenting design properties (like color palettes and typography) is crucial because:

- 🧩 **Consistency**: Ensures visual consistency across all pages and components.
- 🧠 **Collaboration**: Developers and designers can clearly communicate using shared design language.
- ⚙️ **Reusability**: Components can be reused throughout the project without redesigning from scratch.
- 🎯 **Efficiency**: Saves time by providing predefined styles, which streamline development.
- 🧪 **Testing**: Easier to debug or improve a UI when all design assets are defined.

- ## 👥 Project Roles and Responsibilities

Clearly defining roles ensures accountability, collaboration, and a smooth workflow. Below is a breakdown of the key roles and their responsibilities in the Airbnb Clone project:

## 🧩 UI Component Patterns

This section outlines the reusable UI components that will be developed for the AirBnB Clone project. These components will follow consistent styling and behavior across the application, improving maintainability and user experience.

### 🔻 Planned UI Components

1. **Navbar**
   - Fixed at the top of the screen
   - Contains the brand logo, navigation links (Home, Listings, About), and a user profile/login button
   - Responsive design with a collapsible mobile menu

2. **Property Card**
   - Displays a single property in the listings view
   - Includes an image, property name, location, price per night, rating, and a quick "View Details" button
   - Designed for use in both grid and list layouts

3. **Footer**
   - Contains contact information, links to policies (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service), and social media icons
   - Styled to blend with the overall theme and remain fixed/sticky if necessary

> Additional components may be added as the design evolves, including modals, form fields, rating stars, image sliders, and more.
